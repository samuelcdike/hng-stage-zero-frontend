# HNG Internship – Stage 1 Task

## 🧩 Overview
This project builds on my Stage 0 task to create a **multi-page web application** using semantic HTML, accessible forms, and responsive design principles.

The app now consists of:
- 🏠 **Profile Page (index.html)** — a personal profile card showcasing my details, social links, hobbies, and dislikes.
- ✉️ **Contact Us Page (contact.html)** — a form with full client-side validation (name, email, subject, message).
- 👤 **About Me Page (about.html)** — a reflective section with bio, goals, areas of low confidence, and a note to my future self.

All pages share a **modern, accessible design**, a **unified style system**, and a **dynamic navigation bar** for consistent layout.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Semantic HTML elements (`main`, `section`, `nav`, `article`)
- Form validation with meaningful error messages
- Fully responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessibility compliance (labels, ARIA, alt text, keyboard navigation)
- Reusable navigation bar (`nav.js`) dynamically injected into all pages
- Consistent styling via a shared `style.css`

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & media queries)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & validation)
- Git & GitHub
- Netlify (for deployment)
